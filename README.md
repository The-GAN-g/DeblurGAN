# DeblurGAN

## Abstract:

Motion blur in videos and images is a fundamental problem in computer vision which leads to significant degradation of the image, impacting its quality. Many computer vision tasks like image/video analysis, object detection, and recognition rely on local features and descriptors and it is well known that motion blur decreases the performance of the traditional detectors and descriptors. Hence, in this project, we attempt to re-implement the DeblurGAN; an end-to-end learned method for motion deblurring, based on conditional GAN and content loss. We test the quality of de-blurred images by evaluating it on a real-world problem â€“ Object detection. Here, we try to re-implement the image deblurring model presented by https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07064v4.pdf .

### System Requirements:

- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN
- PyTorch

### Training the model:

The GoPro Large dataset can be downloaded from: https://github.com/SeungjunNah/DeepDeblur_release

To organize the data into the proper folders run the organize_gopro_dataset.py file:

```
python organize_gopro_dataset.py --dir_in=GOPRO_Large --dir_out=images

```
To train the data run the below command:

```
python train.py
```
The training outputs a state_dict file with the weights and biases at the end of every 20 epochs. This file is used for testing.

To test the model:

Change the phase value in CreateDataLoader.py from ```phase = 'train/' ``` to ```phase = 'test/'``` and enter the name of state_dict file in test.py file. For example, ```G.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_G_100.pt'))```.

```
python test.py

```
